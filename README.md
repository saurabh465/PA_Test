# PA_Test

# Tasks to Complete:
## Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Load and explore each dataset to identify missing values, outliers, or any data quality issues.
Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.
## User Behavior Analysis:
Analyze user interactions to identify the most visited pages and the average time spent on each page.
Determine the click-through rate for different sections of the website (e.g., homepage, product categories).
Create visualizations to present your findings effectively.
## Purchase Analysis:
Calculate the overall conversion rate for the website based on purchase data.
Identify the top-selling products and product categories.
Explore the relationship between the number of interactions on the website and the likelihood of a purchase.
## Cohort Analysis:
Perform a cohort analysis based on user sign-up dates to understand user retention and behavior over time.
Determine the lifetime value (LTV) of customers acquired during different time periods.
## Website Performance Optimization:
Analyze website performance metrics to identify areas for improvement.
Propose strategies to reduce bounce rate and improve the conversion rate.
Create a visualization dashboard to monitor website performance in real-time.



# Steps to Solve :
1) delete dublicate values from each file : user_interactions.csv ,purchase_data.csv,website_performance.csv by Excel
2) Load files in Jupyter Notebook
3) Use Pandas to fill missing values 
4) use seaborn (Boxplot) to find outliers 
5) use formula to find conversion rate ( conversion_rate = (total_conversions / total_visitors) * 100 )
   and Group by and sort by to find Top Products
5)use Matplotlib.pyplot for plotting graphs to find Relationship between Interactions and Purchase Likelihood ,
and website performance
6)Visualize using graph by Matplotlib

   ## Use Power Bi for Better Understanding and Easy to Find Insights
